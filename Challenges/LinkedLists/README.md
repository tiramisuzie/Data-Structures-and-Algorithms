# Linked List

## Challenge
Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k from the end of the linked list. You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges. led insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O Time = O(n) // Big O Space = O(1)
Both the time and the space of this algorithm is O(n). Within the algorithm executed within the challenge one of the restraints that we have in the C# language is that we have fixed size arrays. This requires any changes to the array to result in a brand new array being instantiated.
