# Breadth-First Traversal
## Challenge 
Create breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach; print every visited nodeâ€™s value.
## Approach and Efficiency
Time: O(n) since it traverses through each node 
Space: O(w) since a depends on the width of the tree at any given level
