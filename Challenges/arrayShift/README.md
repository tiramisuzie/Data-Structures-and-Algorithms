# Insert and Shift an Array

## Challenge
Write a method called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. 
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the 
new value added at the middle index. 

## Approach & Efficiency

1. Big O Time = O(n) // Big O Space = O(n)
	- Both the time and the space of this algorithm is O(n). Within the algorithm executed within the challenge
	one of the restraints that we have in the C# language is that we have fixed size arrays. This requires
	any changes to the array to result in a brand new array being instantiated.
