# Graph 
Implementation of a nondirectional, weighted graph. 

Vertices - These may be thought of as nodes in the graph.
Edges - The connection between two nodes. The weight of the connection may vary.
Neighbor - Nodes next to a given vertex.
Degree - The number of connections a vertex has.

# Big O

Size() O(1)
GetNodes() O(1)
AddEdge() O(1) on average, O(n) worst case
GetNeighbors() O(1)
