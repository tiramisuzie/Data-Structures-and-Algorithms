# MERGE SORT
Merge sort is a sorting technique based on divide and conquer technique. With worst-case time complexity being Ο(n log n), it is one of the most respected algorithms. Merge sort first divides the array into equal halves and then combines them in a sorted manner.

## Time and Space complexity 
Time: Ο(n log n)
Space: o(n)
