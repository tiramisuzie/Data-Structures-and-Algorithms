Merge two linked lists.
## Challenge
Write a function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list.


 Big O Time = O(n) // Big O Space = O(1)
	- returning the linked list is the most space efficient
