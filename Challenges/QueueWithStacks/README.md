# Queue with Stacks
Implement a Queue using two Stacks. Implemented Queue with the following methods:

enqueue(value) which inserts value into the Queue using a first-in, first-out approach.
dequeue() which extracts a value from the Queue using a first-in, first-out approach.
The Stack instances have only push and pop methods, and a size property (size property is optional). Instantiate these Stack objects in your Queue constructor.

## Big O
Enqueue(value)

* Space complexity: O(n)
* Time complexity: O(1)

Dequeue()

* Space complexity: O(1)
* Time complexity: O(n)
